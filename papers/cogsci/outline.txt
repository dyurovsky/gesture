Gesture Paper Outline

Intro
	Language learning as active interaction between parent and child
	Do even linguistically inexperienced children contribute to the interaction in a goal directed way?
	If communication is the goal, then -- Time pressure on in-the-moment communication
	Retrieval time for words depends on fluency (we use frequency as a proxy, Wingfield 1968)
	If this is true, and kids are taking too long, they might gesture instead
	race model as a framework theory

	three predictions:
		1. frequency predicts gesture vs. speech
		2. over development, children learn more language and so speech should win the race more often because words should be easier to retrieve
		3. recent boosts in a word should make it easier to retrieve: in the same discourse burst, more likely to use speech for low frequency words

	We look at a big longitudinal corpus to test these predictions

Method
	Data
		Who's in the corpus? How was it collected, etc.
	Processing
		How was gesture coded? How was referent coded? Concrete nouns, etc
	Show a table?? of the end state for analysis
		person, utterance, gesture? referent -- Table 1
	Frequency distribution plot
		show some common words for reference -- Figure 1

	second pass for presentness
		- some descriptive stats, predictive accuracy

	reliability

Results

	Predictions 1 and 2
		Big lmer, main effects, interactions

		Big multi-age plot -- Figure 2

		Say something about parents?

		address concreteness?

	Prediction 3
		Explain bag of words model of discourse, show a little gleitman coded for "same topic" -- Figure 3

		lmer

		Figure for recency?

General Discussion
	- language happens in interactions
	- kids contribute
	- language as a non-stationary process -- depends on the kid themselves
	- how do parents and children differ in their use of gesture? gesture can do things other than refer. Gesture for labelling (both??)
